# Bluetooth to USB

![Bluetooth to USB Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quaxalber/bluetooth_2_usb/main/assets/overview.png)

Convert a Raspberry Pi into a HID relay that translates Bluetooth keyboard and mouse input to USB. Additionally, supports sending keystrokes remotely from your PC or phone via Bluetooth LE service. Minimal configuration. Zero hassle.

The issue with Bluetooth devices is that you usually can't use them to:
- wake up sleeping devices,
- access the BIOS or OS select menu (e.g., GRUB),
- access devices without Bluetooth interface (e.g., devices in a restricted environment or most KVM switches).

Sounds familiar? Congratulations! **You just found the solution!**

Linux's gadget mode allows a Raspberry Pi to act as USB HID (Human Interface Device). Therefore, from the host's perspective, it appears like a regular USB keyboard or mouse. You may think of your Pi as a multi-device Bluetooth dongle.

## 1. Features

**HID relay:**
- Simple installation and highly automated setup
- Supports multiple input devices (currently keyboard and mouse - more than one of each kind simultaneously)
- Supports [146 multimedia keys](https://github.com/quaxalber/bluetooth_2_usb/blob/8b1c5f8097bbdedfe4cef46e07686a1059ea2979/lib/evdev_adapter.py#L142) (e.g., mute, volume up/down, launch browser, etc.)
- Auto-discovery feature for input devices
- Auto-reconnect feature for input devices (power off, energy saving mode, out of range, etc.)
- Robust error handling and logging
- Installation as a systemd service
- Reliable concurrency using state-of-the-art [TaskGroups](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task-groups)
- Clean and actively maintained code base

**Bluetooth LE service:**
- Supports sending keystrokes (a series of shortcuts) remotely from your PC or phone. See [4.3 Bluetooth to USB GATT](#43-bluetooth-to-usb-gatt) for usage guidelines.
- Accepts (almost) any format. Both Linux keycode names (see [Adaftuit keycodes](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/hid/en/latest/_modules/adafruit_hid/keycode.html)) and [Windows ones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) are supported.
  Example of input: `Win-R n,o,t,e,p,a,d Enter`
- Works as a Bluetooth GATT Service (is compatiblle with existing BLE GATT client applications)
- Requires client device to be paired (may be disabled by `--accept-non-trusted` command-line argument; if enabled, only whitelisted devices may send the keystrokes).
- Returns error if invalid keystroke is sent (may be disabled by `--partial-parse-ble-command` command-line argument)
- May be disabled using `--no-ble-relay` option
- Tested on Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi Zero W and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

## 2. Requirements

- A Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth and [USB OTG support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go) required for [USB gadgets](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/usb/gadget.html) in so-called device mode. Supported models include:
  - **Raspberry Pi Zero W(H)**: Includes Bluetooth 4.1 and supports USB OTG with the lowest price tag.
  - **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**: Similar to the Raspberry Pi Zero W, it has Bluetooth 4.1 and USB OTG support while providing additional processing power.
  - **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**: Offers Bluetooth 5.0 and USB-C OTG support for device mode, providing the best performance (that is until the Pi 5 is available).
- Raspberry Pi OS ([Bookworm-based](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/bookworm-the-new-version-of-raspberry-pi-os/))
- Python 3.11 for using [TaskGroups](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task-groups).

> [!NOTE]
> Raspberry Pi 3 Models feature Bluetooth 4.2 but no native USB gadget mode support. Earlier models like Raspberry Pi 1 and 2 do not support Bluetooth natively and have no USB gadget mode support.

> [!NOTE]
> The latest version of Raspberry Pi OS, based on Debian Bookworm, supports Python 3.11 through the official package repositories. For older versions, you may [build it from source](https://github.com/quaxalber/bluetooth_2_usb/blob/main/scripts/build_python_3.11.sh). Note that building may take anything between a few minutes (Pi 4B) and more than an hour (Pi 0W).

## 3. Installation

Follow these steps to install and configure the project:

### 3.1. Prerequisites

1. Install Raspberry Pi OS on your Raspberry Pi (e.g., using [Pi Imager](https://youtu.be/ntaXWS8Lk34))

2. Connect to a network via Ethernet cable or [Wi-Fi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#configuring-networking). Make sure this network has Internet access.

3. (*optional, recommended*) Enable [SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#ssh), if you intend to access the Pi remotely.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings above may be configured [during imaging](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#advanced-options) (recommended), [on first boot](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#configuration-on-first-boot) or [afterwards](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html).

4. Connect to the Pi and make sure `git` is installed:

   ```console
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install -y git
   ```

5. Pair and trust any Bluetooth devices you wish to relay, either via GUI or via CLI:

   ```console
   bluetoothctl
   scan on
   ```

   ... wait for your devices to show up and note their MAC addresses (you may also type the first characters and hit `TAB` for auto-completion in the following commands) ...

   ```console
   trust A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6
   pair A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6
   connect A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6` by your input device's Bluetooth MAC address

### 3.2. Setup

1. On the Pi, clone the repository to your home directory:

   ```console
   # as it is for now the BLE servie feature is not complete and located at forked repo
   # cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/quaxalber/bluetooth_2_usb.git
   cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/ig-sinicyn/bluetooth_2_usb.git
   ```

2. Run the installation script as root:

   ```console
   sudo ~/bluetooth_2_usb/scripts/install.sh
   ```

3.  Reboot:

    ```console
    sudo reboot
    ```

4.  Verify that the service is running:

    ```console
    service bluetooth_2_usb status
    ```

    It should look something like this and say `Active: active (running)`:

    ```console
    user@pi0w:~ $ service bluetooth_2_usb status
    ● bluetooth_2_usb.service - Bluetooth to USB HID relay

### 3.3. Known issues

**No module named 'evdev' error**

This error may occur on fresh Bookworm images. May be fixed with
```console
sudo apt install python3-evdev
```

**Python.h: No such file or directory error**

This error may occur on fresh Bookworm images. May be fixed with
```console
sudo apt install libpython3.11-dev
```

## 4. Usage

### 4.1. Connection to target device / host

#### 4.1.1. Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

Connect the _USB-C power port_ of your Pi 4B via cable with a USB port on your target device. You should hear the USB connection sound (depending on the target device) and be able to access your target device wirelessly using your Bluetooth keyboard or mouse. In case the Pi solely draws power from the host, it will take some time for the Pi to boot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's essential to use the small power port instead of the bigger USB-A ports, since only the power port has the [OTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go) feature required for [USB gadgets](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/usb/gadget.html).

#### 4.1.2. Raspberry Pi Zero (2) W(H)

For the Pi Zero, the situation is quite the opposite: Do _not_ use the power port to connect to the target device, _use_ the other port instead (typically labeled "DATA" or "USB"). You may connect the power port to a stable power supply.

### 4.2. Command-line arguments

Currently you can provide the following CLI arguments:

```console
user@pi0w:~ $ bluetooth_2_usb -h
usage: bluetooth_2_usb.py [--device_ids DEVICE_IDS] [--auto_discover] [--grab_devices] [--list_devices] [--log_to_file] [--log_path LOG_PATH] [--debug] [--version] [--help]

Bluetooth to USB HID relay. Handles Bluetooth keyboard and mouse events from multiple input devices and translates them to USB using Linux's gadget mode.

options:
  --device_ids DEVICE_IDS, -i DEVICE_IDS
                        Comma-separated list of identifiers for input devices to be relayed.
                        An identifier is either the input device path, the MAC address or any case-insensitive substring of the device name.
                        Example: --device_ids '/dev/input/event2,a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6,0A-1B-2C-3D-4E-5F,logi'
                        Default: None
  --auto_discover, -a   Enable auto-discovery mode. All readable input devices will be relayed automatically.
                        Default: disabled
  --grab_devices, -g    Grab the input devices, i.e., suppress any events on your relay device.
                        Devices are not grabbed by default.
  --list_devices, -l    List all available input devices and exit.
  --no-input-relay      Disable input relay mode (sends input keys to USB HID device)
                        Default: input relay enabled.
  --no-ble-relay        Disable BLE relay mode (BLE server that sends keystrokes to USB HID device)
                        Default: BLE relay enabled.
  --accept-non-trusted  UNSAFE! Accepts non-trusted BLE relay clients.
  --partial-parse-ble-command
                        Enables partial parsing of BLE input (ignores unknown keystrokes).
  --log_to_file, -f     Add a handler that logs to file, additionally to stdout.
  --log_path LOG_PATH, -p LOG_PATH
                        The path of the log file
                        Default: /var/log/bluetooth_2_usb/bluetooth_2_usb.log
  --debug, -d           Enable debug mode (Increases log verbosity)
                        Default: disabled
  --version, -v         Display the version number of this software and exit.
  --help, -h            Show this help message and exit.
```

### 4.3 Bluetooth to USB GATT

This service allows you to send keystrokes remotely from your PC or phone.

The things you need to know:
* The bluetooth address of the Pi device (may be obtained by `hcitool dev` command)
* Names of GATT service and characteristic to use. Currently these are not configurable and are equal to `00000000-6907-4437-8539-9218a9d54e29` and `00000001-6907-4437-8539-9218a9d54e29`
* You must pair your client device with Raspberry Pi (the pairing must be triggered on the client side). Some clients do support auto-pairing, others require you to do it manually.

**Keystrokes format**

TLDR example: `Win-1, F5, Alt-Tab` switches to the first app in the windows taskbar, presses F5 and switches back.

Each keystroke contains one or more shortcuts. The shortcuts are separated by whitespace (` `), comma (`,`) or semicolon (`;`) symbols.

Each shortcut represents a combination of keys that will be presseed simultaneously. The key names are separated by dash ('-') or plus (`+`) symbols.

Key names are case sensitive. Both Linux keycode names (see [Adaftuit keycodes](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/hid/en/latest/_modules/adafruit_hid/keycode.html)) and [Windows ones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) are supported.

More examples:
```
Ctrl-E,Ctrl-K             # Two sequental shortcuts, Ctrl-E and Ctrl-K
Ctrl+Alt+P                # A single shortcut, Ctrl-Alt-P
LAlt-M;RAlt-D             # Two sequental shortcuts, Left Alt-M and Right Alt-D
Win-R n,o,t,e,p,a,d Enter # Starts a notepad app
```

#### 4.3.1 Cross-platform python client sample

This basic sample is included [as part of the repo](https://github.com/ig-sinicyn/bluetooth_2_usb/blob/feature/ble-relay/src/gatt_client/client.py).
Assuming you have configured python venv, dependencies may be installed by running following command in the root of the repository (choose the one for your OS):
```
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m pip install -r .\requirements.client.txt
deactivate

# Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
py -m pip install -r .\requirements.client.txt
deactivate
```

**Usage:**
```console
>py 'src/gatt_client/client.py'
usage: client.py [-h] [--address ADDRESS] [--characteristic CHARACTERISTIC] value

> py 'src/gatt_client/client.py' '-a' 'B8:27:EB:9C:F6:4C' '-c' '00000001-6907-4437-8539-9218a9d54e29' 'Alt-Tab'
Connected to B8:27:EB:9C:F6:4C: True
Writing value 'Alt-Tab'
Value 'Alt-Tab' written to characteristic '00000001-6907-4437-8539-9218a9d54e29'
```

> [!NOTE]
> Sometimes (very rarely) client fails with 'Device with address <address> was not found'. This error seems to be fixed by running client multiple times or by restarting the 'Bluetooth Support Service' service.

> [!NOTE]
> GATT Client execution time may take up to several second on Windows. It is recommended to try other clients that may work much faster.

#### 4.3.2 Windows clients

These are existing windows 10 + clients such as [BleConsole](https://github.com/sensboston/BLEConsole) and [Bluetooth LE Lab](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n6jd37gwzc8) but these are hard to use in automation.

So, there is [BleTools](https://github.com/ig-sinicyn/BleTools) as set of fast (~300ms to run) and robust utilites for writing. Please check [the documentation](https://github.com/ig-sinicyn/BleTools/blob/master/README.md) for more details.
Example:
```console
> .\BleTools.Write.exe
Usage: BleTools.Write bluetooth-address service characteristic value

Writes GATT service characteristic

Arguments:
  0: bluetooth-address    MAC address of the Bluetooth LE device (Required)
  1: service              GATT service UUID (Required)
  2: characteristic       GATT service characteristic UUID (Required)
  3: value                The new characteristic value (passed as UTF-8 string) (Required)

Options:
  -h, --help     Show help message

> .\BleTools.Write.exe B8:27:EB:9C:F6:4C 00000000-6907-4437-8539-9218a9d54e29 00000001-6907-4437-8539-9218a9d54e29 Win
Value 'Win' written to service / characteristic 00000000-6907-4437-8539-9218a9d54e29 / 00000001-6907-4437-8539-9218a9d54e29 (device B8:27:EB:9C:F6:4C).
```

#### 4.3.3 Android clients
Almost all BLE clients on Android uses system api and works equally fine. The ones we checked are:
* [BlueTooth Terminal eDebugger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.e.debugger)
* [nRF Connect for Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp)

### 4.4. Consuming the API from your Python code

The API is designed such that it may be consumed both via CLI and from within external Python code. More details on this [coming soon](https://github.com/quaxalber/bluetooth_2_usb/issues/16)!

## 5. Updating

You may update to the latest stable release by running:

```console
sudo ~/bluetooth_2_usb/scripts/update.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> The update script performs a clean reinstallation, that is run `uninstall.sh`, delete the repo folder, clone again and run the install script. The current branch will be maintained.

## 6. Uninstallation

You may uninstall Bluetooth 2 USB by running:

```console
sudo ~/bluetooth_2_usb/scripts/uninstall.sh
```

## 7. Troubleshooting

### 7.1. The Pi keeps rebooting or crashes randomly

This is likely due to the limited power the Pi can draw from the host's USB port. Try these steps:

- check the output of `vcgencmd get_throttled` and `vcgencmd measure_temp` commands. The Throttled status should be `0x0` and the temperature has to be less than 80°C (on most devices average temperature is in range 40-50 °C).

- If available, connect your Pi to a USB 3 port on the host / target device (usually blue) or preferably USB-C.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *Do not use* the blue (or black) USB-A ports *of your Pi* to connect. **This won't work.**
>
> *Do use* the small USB-C power port (in case of Pi 4B). For Pi Zero, use the data port to connect to the host and attach the power port to a dedicated power supply.

- Try to [connect to the Pi via SSH](#31-prerequisites) instead of attaching a display directly and remove any unnecessary peripherals.

- Install a [lite version](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/) of your OS on the Pi (without GUI)

- For Pi 4B: Get a [USB-C Data/Power Splitter](https://thepihut.com/products/usb-c-data-power-splitter) and draw power from a dedicated power supply. This should ultimately resolve any power-related issues, and your Pi 4B will no longer be dependent on the host's power supply.

> [!NOTE]
> The Pi Zero is recommended to have a 1.2 A power supply for stable operation, the Pi Zero 2 requires 2.0 A and the Pi 4B even 3.0 A, while hosts may typically only supply up to 0.5/0.9 A through USB-A 2.0/3.0 ports. However, this may be sufficient depending on your specific soft- and hardware configuration. For more information see the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#power-supply).

### 7.2. The installation was successful, but I don't see any output on the target device

This could be due to a number of reasons. Try these steps:

- Verify that the service is running:

  ```console
  service bluetooth_2_usb status
  ```

- Verify that you specified the correct input devices in `bluetooth_2_usb.service`

- Verify that your Bluetooth devices are paired, trusted, connected and *not* blocked:

  ```console
  bluetoothctl
  info A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6
  ```

  It should look like this:

  ```console
  user@pi0w:~ $ bluetoothctl
  Agent registered
  [CHG] Controller 0A:1B:2C:3D:4E:5F Pairable: yes
  [AceRK]# info A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6

          UUID: Nordic UART Service       (6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e)
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6` by your input device's Bluetooth MAC address

- Reload and restart service:

  ```console
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo service bluetooth_2_usb restart
  ```

- Reboot Pi

  ```console
  sudo reboot
  ```

- Re-connect the Pi to the host and check that the cable is capable of transmitting data, not power only

- Try a different USB port on the host

- Try connecting to a different host

### 7.3. In bluetoothctl, my device is constantly switching on/off

This is a common issue, especially when the device gets paired with multiple hosts. One simple fix/workaround is to re-pair the device:

```console
bluetoothctl
power off
power on
block A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6
remove A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6
scan on
trust A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6
pair A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6
connect A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6
```

If the issue persists, it's worth trying to delete the cache:

```console
sudo -i
cd '/var/lib/bluetooth/0A:1B:2C:3D:4E:5F/cache'
rm -rf 'A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6'
exit
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `0A:1B:2C:3D:4E:5F` by your Pi's Bluetooth controller's MAC and `A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6` by your input device's MAC

### 7.4. There are occansional Bluetooth disconnects on Pi Zero 2

Please check that you're not using full-size metal case or cover. These are known to reduce Bluetooth connectivity range. If so, try to place your client device clother to the Pi Zero 2.

Also, please check that you're use proper power source for your device (as specified in [7.1. The Pi keeps rebooting](#71-the-pi-keeps-rebooting-or-crashes-randomly)).

### 7.5. There are occansional Wi-Fi disconnects on Pi Zero 2

There's a known issue with fresh Bookworm images. Sometimes the device does not respond to incoming Wi-Fi network requests.

For this issue, try to disable power_save mode for the wlan0 as suggested [here](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=2024045&sid=41607aa3904668e8120e9188a29c474c#p2024045).

**Occansional bluetooth disconnects**

At first, please check that you're not usig full-size metal case or cover. These are known to reduce Bluetooth connectivity range. If so, try to place your client device clother to the RPi.

Also, please check that you're use proper power source for your device. Raspberry Pi is known to have connectivity issues when underpowered.

**Bluetooth reconnects takes too long**
Try to set
```
FastConnectable = true
```
in the `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf`.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling the FastConnectable option increases power consumption for the device.

### 7.6. I have a different issue

Here's a few things you could try:

- Check the log files (default at `/var/log/bluetooth_2_usb/`) for errors

> [!NOTE]
> Logging to file requires the `-f` flag

- You may also query the journal to inspect the service logs in real-time:

  ```console
  journalctl -u bluetooth_2_usb.service -n 50 -f
  ```

- For easier degguging, you may temporarily stop the service and run the script manually, modifying arguments as required, e.g., increase log verbosity by appending `-d`:

  ```console
  sudo service bluetooth_2_usb stop && sudo bluetooth_2_usb -ad ; sudo service bluetooth_2_usb start
  ```

- When you interact with your Bluetooth devices with `-d` set, you should see debug output in the logs such as:

  ```console
  user@pi0w:~/bluetooth_2_usb $ sudo service bluetooth_2_usb stop && sudo bluetooth_2_usb -i hdmi,a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6,/dev/input/event3 -d ; sudo service bluetooth_2_usb start

### 7.7. Everything is working, but can it help me with Bitcoin mining?

Absolutely! [Here's how](https://bit.ly/42BTC).

## 8. Bonus points

After successfully setting up your Pi as a HID proxy for your Bluetooth devices, you may consider making [Raspberry Pi OS read-only](https://learn.adafruit.com/read-only-raspberry-pi/overview). That helps preventing the SD card from wearing out and the file system from getting corrupted when powering off the Raspberry forcefully.
